# beam-design

This is a Xojo project for the design of reinforced concrete beams. This was part of my final Bachelor's final project.

## Usage
Just open the _main.xojo_binary_project_ in Xojo. 

## Structural Analysis Module
The module *PorticoPlano* is actually an implementation of the [Direct Stiffness Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_stiffness_method), that can be extended to other truss structures. The remaining modules are specific to this beam design project.
